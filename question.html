                <h3>How to destroy Thanos?</h3>
                Guys, Thanos wants to take over my planet, 
                I have never encountered this problem. 
                Can you please tell me where can I get the team in order to defeat him.
                I am interested in all the information regarding services for finding
                allies, shops where you can buy equipment, corporations that sell unique weapons.
                I would also like to know where it is easiest to recruit several 
                million soldiers, where you can buy a couple of hundred tanks inexpensively.

                        I have answers to your questions! You can assemble a team on any social 
                        network, the best choice is VK. It is possible to buy weapons and equipment
                        in bulk from one of the countries involved in such trade. Ordinary
                        mercenaries are suitable for creating an army. With tanks, not everything
                        is so simple, it is easiest to make them yourself. Good luck saving the world!
